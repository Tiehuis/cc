### Compiler

Hopefully this will eventually be a self-hosting c compiler. Will need to wait
and see.

### Progress and Todo

 - [x] Build a trivial lexer and parser
 - [x] Extend these to build an AST and evaluate c expressions
 - [ ] Make the parser type-aware
 - [ ] Add variable assignment support
 - [ ] Add postifix/prefix expressions
 - [ ] Add function definition support
 - [ ] Add support for looping constructs

 Eventually...
 - [ ] Pointer and addressing support
 - [ ] Assembly code generation
 - [ ] A more complete interpreter
 - [ ] C99 complete
 - [ ] Some other feature additions to C I'd like to see (branch)

And lots more.
